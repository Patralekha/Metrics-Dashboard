## Verify the monitoring installation

*TODO:* run `kubectl` command to show the running pods and services for the three components. Copy and paste the output or take a screenshot of the output and include it here to verify the installation

## Setup the Jaeger and Prometheus source
*TODO:* Expose Grafana to the internet and then setup Prometheus as a data source. Provide a screenshot of the home page after logging into Grafana.

## Create a Basic Dashboard
*TODO:* Create a dashboard in Grafana that shows Prometheus as a source. Take a screenshot and include it here.

## Describe SLO/SLI
*TODO:* Describe, in your own words, what the SLIs are, based on an SLO of *monthly uptime* and *request response time*.

SLI is the actual metric that measures or tells us the performance of a service.It is a real number generally expressed as percentage.
SLO is the goal or objective that a team aims to accomplish so that the customers expectations can be met.More specifically it is a range that a team aims to maintain such that the SLI falls within this range or exceeds the goal set in way that meets the customer's expectations.For example SLO is likely 99.85% uptime and  SLI is the actual measurement of your uptime. It can be 99.86%. 

## Creating SLI metrics.
*TODO:* It is important to know why we want to measure certain metrics for our customer. Describe in detail 5 metrics to measure these SLIs. 

1.Uptime: the percentage of time our service is available and working as expected \n
2.Traffic: number of requests per second to our service \n
3.Errors per second: number of requsts per second to our service that fails with 40x or 50x error codes \n
4.Resource Utilization: the percentage of CPU and memory utilized by our service \n
5.Latency: the time taken by our service to respond to a request that is sent \n

## Create a Dashboard to measure our SLIs
*TODO:* Create a dashboard to measure the uptime of the frontend and backend services We will also want to measure to measure 40x and 50x errors. Create a dashboard that show these values over a 24 hour period and take a screenshot.

## Tracing our Flask App
*TODO:*  We will create a Jaeger span to measure the processes on the backend. Once you fill in the span, provide a screenshot of it here.

## Jaeger in Dashboards
*TODO:* Now that the trace is running, let's add the metric to our current Grafana dashboard. Once this is completed, provide a screenshot of it here.

## Report Error
*TODO:* Using the template below, write a trouble ticket for the developers, to explain the errors that you are seeing (400, 500, latency) and to let them know the file that is causing the issue.

TROUBLE TICKET

Subject:

Affected Area:

Severity:

Description:


## Creating SLIs and SLOs
*TODO:* We want to create an SLO guaranteeing that our application has a 99.95% uptime per month. Name three SLIs that you would use to measure the success of this SLO.

## Building KPIs for our plan
*TODO*: Now that we have our SLIs and SLOs, create KPIs to accurately measure these metrics. We will make a dashboard for this, but first write them down here.

## Final Dashboard
*TODO*: Create a Dashboard containing graphs that capture all the metrics of your KPIs and adequately representing your SLIs and SLOs. Include a screenshot of the dashboard here, and write a text description of what graphs are represented in the dashboard.
